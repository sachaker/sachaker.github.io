My name is Sacha (McElligott) Schermerhorn—welcome to my website! 


I was born in London to a musician and a photographer, and moved to San Francisco when I was 6. As a kid I attended the [Paul Green School of Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_(musician)#The_Paul_Green_School_of_Rock_Music), focused heavily on art and chess, skied, and made skateboarding videos with my friends. Exploring these diverse interests played a huge role in shaping me!


Work-wise, I did ~8 years in neuroscience before getting into startups. My time in neuroscience resulted in 2 major fellowships from the NSF (I won the [NSF GRPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP)) and the [NIH](http://www.bpendure.org/sacha-mcelligott.html) (~$200k total), 2 publications—one highlighting a novel protein involved in Alzheimer's disease ([here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337725238_Secernin-1_is_a_novel_phosphorylated_tau_binding_protein_that_accumulates_in_Alzheimer's_disease_and_not_in_other_tauopathies)) and another highlighting decision signals in a low-level sensory area of the rodent brain (published in Nature Neuroscience, [here](http://nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01151-0))—12 conference presentations, a departmental [thesis award](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/honors-programs/dean-awards.html), and 6 university-wide grants. I worked on every model you can imagine (rodents, NHPs, fruit flies, humans, etc.) and in many different domains within neuroscience (computational, visual, neurogenetics, psychophysics, etc.).
       
After building 8 or so products during the initial COVID lockdown, I got into [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app), through which I met my cofounder for [Lolly](https://www.thelollyapp.com) (more on us [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/01/15/meet-lolly-the-new-gen-z-dating-app-combining-tiktok-and-tinder/).) I can't tell you how much those experiences changed my life. I am so lucky.

I obsessively collect data on a lot of things in my life. Some examples include: places I've eaten, people I've seen, phone calls I've had, movies I've seen, times I wake up, Wikipedias I've read, dreams I've had, coffees I've had, etc. These lists have been going for >2 years and are not unique (I've been to Sweetgreen 68 times since October 16th, 2020.) I also wrote some code to track every keystroke, my mouse position (@ 40Hz!), as well as the apps I use at any given time (a la [Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/)).

Currently, I am building a new company in stealth.
