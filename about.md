My name is Sacha (McElligott) Schermerhornâ€”welcome to my website! 


I was born in London to a musician and a photographer, and moved to San Francisco when I was 6. As a kid I went to the [Paul Green School of Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_(musician)#The_Paul_Green_School_of_Rock_Music), focused heavily on art and chess, skied, and made skateboarding videos with my friends. Exploring these diverse interests played a huge role in shaping me!


Work-wise, I started things off with ~8 years in neuroscience. My time in the field resulted in 2 major fellowships from the [NSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP) and [NIH](http://www.bpendure.org/sacha-mcelligott.html) (~$200k total), [1 publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337725238_Secernin-1_is_a_novel_phosphorylated_tau_binding_protein_that_accumulates_in_Alzheimer's_disease_and_not_in_other_tauopathies) (another on its way!), 12 conference presentations, a departmental [thesis award](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/honors-programs/dean-awards.html), and 6 university-wide grants.
       
I then co-founded [Lolly](https://www.thelollyapp.com) (more on us [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/01/15/meet-lolly-the-new-gen-z-dating-app-combining-tiktok-and-tinder/).)

I'm now helping startups with product and growth as well as hacking away at some side projects! For various reasons, I'm keeping those startups and side projects private (at least for now.)

If you'd like to know more about my work background, it's all on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachamce/). Feel free to connect with me!
