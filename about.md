My name is Sacha McElligottâ€”welcome to my website! 


I was born in London to a musician and a photographer, and moved to San Francisco when I was 6. As a kid I went to the [Paul Green School of Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_(musician)#The_Paul_Green_School_of_Rock_Music), focused heavily on art and chess, skied, and made skateboarding videos with my friends. Exploring these diverse interests played a huge role in shaping me!


Currently getting over a breakup with neuroscience after an 8 year relationship (:cry:??). My time in the field resulted in 2 major fellowships from the [NSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP) and [NIH](http://www.bpendure.org/sacha-mcelligott.html) (~$200k total), [1 publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337725238_Secernin-1_is_a_novel_phosphorylated_tau_binding_protein_that_accumulates_in_Alzheimer's_disease_and_not_in_other_tauopathies) (another on its way!), 12 conference presentations, a departmental [thesis award](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/honors-programs/dean-awards.html), and 6 university-wide grants.
       
       
On the professional front, I'm the President of [Replay](https://www.joinreplay.com), a venture-backed startup that is redefining the way people date online. The level of talent on the team is staggering and I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of it.
       
       
I hope you enjoy the site, making it has been a fun project on its own.
