# **Change vs. Progress**

It is incredibly important not to conflate change with progress. 

Progress exists at the intersection between change (state B ≠ state A) and growth (some optimization towards the objective). Change can exist without growth (e.g. a new presidency, binary fission of a bacterium, etc.), but growth cannot exist without change (some sense of modification is requisite for optimization).

Without a driving force towards growth, the action or change will be what we can call "yieldless". For example, if I choose to go running, the act of running itself may in fact be the objective, and that will hold under any context in which I am running. However, if my goal has shifted to using running as a means of achieving something else (like moving from point A to point B), then the actions that progress me towards that goal become contextual—running on a treadmill achieves the same action without any progress (as defined by the context). By the same token, science has the bad habit of feigning progress where, in most instances, we are simply just running in place.<sup>1</sup>

It is very easy to see changes within science and be excited by the carrot of progress, but how have those changes progressed us towards the initial objective? In medicine, as an admitted generalization, the objective function is easily defined: are we closer to curing the disease in question? Without proper heuristics for determining this, yiedless changes can safely hide under the veil of progress.<sup>2</sup>

I suspect that we would benefit greatly from inoculating ourselves to the allure of change and no longer misconstruing it as progress. Who would have thought that using the ultimate goal to guide the action could be so hard??

# **On progress**

[Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/) and [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) made waves with their arguably seminal article "[We Need a Need Science of Progress](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/)". In this article, they outline the stagnation in progress across various industries and the dire need to establish heurestics for tracking their respective progresses. What was so curious about the article's success was the fact that it took so long for anyone to really voice this almost obvious solution.

Perhaps since the dawn of civilization there have existed dissenting groups that point at societal frameworks and expose their shortcomings, particularly in their ability to enact positive change or progress. Ironically, I am not aware of any notable expositions (like the Collison-Cowen article) that explicitly express the need to systematically enforce the tracking of progress itself. 

Now there are many important considerations for defining progress that I believe are requisite for the actual implementation of "Progress Studies". Here are some early ones that come to mind:

- Should we consider progress to be relative or absolute? If relative, then to what?
- How do we start to build metrics that can accurately assess progress and how can we further develop metrics that track the usability of progress metrics?
- 

On the first of these points, I believe that an absolute measure is an absolute necessity. [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) once said "If you look back on yourself [in a year] and don't think you were dumb then, you mustn't have learned much", and this is an interesting proposal for a relative system of progress. What would happen if we measure progress by that which we have achieved relative to the previous year (assuming we have faithful metrics for progress)? This happens all the time with public companies—investors need to see positive and increasing YTD growth or else the company is considered stagnant. I think, when it comes to industries or non-private institutions, metrics with such a short time scale would prove too volatile and probably the comparison date or averaging window should be catered to each industry—a rolling window of about 5 years seems reasonable for academic institutions, for instance.

On the second, this will likely prove to be the hardest of them all. Defining growth is incredibly difficult despite the illusion that there are actual metrics for doing so.
