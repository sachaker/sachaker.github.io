# **Some reflections after some time away**

I have just gotten back from some time away during which I was living very remotely. My hope was that this removal from the tugs of familiar faces and settings would engender some personal clarity about myself and therefore my next chapter post-Lolly.

By no means do I have all the answers, but in an attempt to share some of my experience/resulting conclusions, I have distilled some of my thoughts below:

### 1. Be deliberate ###
The family whose land I was staying on has lived an incredibly alternative and adventurous life. Cambridge educated, in the 1960's the couple decided to abandon their conventional, professional paths for a shared one of extremely rural living.

I have recently been grappling with the fact that the default state of humans is to meander through life and just end up somewhere. However, I also believe we feed ourselves the illusion that each decision we have made has been calculated and was part of a consistent narrative.

One lesson I took away from this couple is that living adventurously is to live randomly—to position one's self in situations that present countless potentialities and to continue to choose the option most fitting in that exact moment of one's life. This is a deliberate choice to chase randomness. **To deliberately meander is different than to meander under the guise of deliberation.** I think most people don't appreciate that fact, but this family certainly did. They chose a life of randomness. Most people live such a life with the illusion that they do not...

My conclusion from this insight is that my own ideal circumstance is to live more deliberately than "adventurously" and insert *occasional* stochasticity/noise to the process to let randomness present a raffle of potentially more meaningful/rich experiences.

### 2. Express gratitude ###
At almost every junction in our life, there is a collection of characters that influences our ultimate pursuit of a given path. I think it is incredibly important to commit time to identifying these characters that have direct or indirect influence (they may have been so seemingly peripheral in your life that they may not even realize) and to explicitly express gratitude for their influence.

Take this as a CTA to send a text or email to at least 1 person who fits that description right now. I believe the greatest gift we can receive in life is to have some sense of impact. Impact in others affirms our existence and begets a deep sense of joy. Go package that gift to someone as a quick message now! :)

### 3. Be the right version of yourself ###
In order to make a judgement, especially in the context of interpersonal relationships, you must be the right version of yourself. I think most literature/thinking on this subject focuses on the ways to find the "right" person. I believe instead that each person needs to hone their internal barometer through personal experience and that they must be sober about how well that barometer is calibrated at any given point in time. 

Finding the right person (a friend, partner, etc.) is about being the right version of yourself. **A healthy question to ask regularly is whether you feel confident in your current self to make a judgement call on someone with whom you may spend years.** This puts more of an onus on the prospector and less on fate to present you with the "perfect person". That person may have slipped right under your nose because you simply weren't ready.

### 4. The opportunity cost of learning is extremely low ###
Learning is perhaps the most

# **Hierarchies**

I believe that humans will always contrive a sense of hierarchy irrespective of the system itself.

There was a great episode of The Fairly OddParents back in the day in which

# **On progress**

[Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/) and [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) made waves with their arguably seminal article "[We Need a Need Science of Progress](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/)". In this article, they outline the stagnation in progress across various industries and the dire need to establish heurestics for tracking their respective progresses. What was so curious about the article's success was the fact that it took so long for anyone to really voice this almost obvious solution.

Perhaps since the dawn of civilization there have existed dissenting groups that point at societal frameworks and expose their shortcomings, particularly in their ability to enact positive change or progress. Ironically, I am not aware of any notable expositions (like the Collison-Cowen article) that explicitly express the need to systematically enforce the tracking of progress itself. 

Now there are many important considerations for defining progress that I believe are requisite for the actual implementation of "Progress Studies". Here are some early ones that come to mind:

- Should we consider progress to be relative or absolute? If relative, then to what?
- How do we start to build metrics that can accurately assess progress and how can we further develop metrics that track the usability of progress metrics?
- 

On the first of these points, I believe that an absolute measure is an absolute necessity. [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) once said "If you look back on yourself [in a year] and don't think you were dumb then, you mustn't have learned much", and this is an interesting proposal for a relative system of progress. What would happen if we measure progress by that which we have achieved relative to the previous year (assuming we have faithful metrics for progress)? This happens all the time with public companies—investors need to see positive and increasing YTD growth or else the company is considered stagnant. I think, when it comes to industries or non-private institutions, metrics with such a short time scale would prove too volatile and probably the comparison date or averaging window should be catered to each industry—a rolling window of about 5 years seems reasonable for academic institutions, for instance.

On the second, this will likely prove to be the hardest of them all. Defining growth is incredibly difficult despite the illusion that there are actual metrics for doing so.
