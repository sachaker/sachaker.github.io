# 1.01^365 = 37.78 0.99^365 = 0.026
While really just a simple mathematic rule (fraction multiplied onto itself will get smallerr, >1 raised to postitive integer will get bigger)... these numbers are a remidner to me that the importance of details - many details working together. A small difference accumulated over time can create large disparity.
